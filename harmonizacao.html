  <p>Have you ever wondered how to find the perfect wine to go with your meal?
    If you’re tired of feeling worried in the wine aisle and want to get to grips with the mystery of food and wine pairing, then read on. All it takes are four very basic principles:
    
    <h2>1. Buy a wine you know you are going to enjoy</h2>
    This may sound obvious, but if you’ve been recommended a great pairing, and it’s a style of wine you loathe, then no matter how ideal a match they may be it’s less likely you will enjoy the experience. So if you know that you enjoy a certain kind of wine, it’s a good place to start when selecting wines to match your special meal.
    
    People often feel embarrassed that their wine or food choices will not be sophisticated enough, just remember wine is all about personal preference. Be brave – if you want to drink a medium sweet white Zinfandel rosé with your rare steak, then go ahead and give it a go. If you fancy sipping your favourite Chablis with an accompaniment of Pringles, then by all means tuck in. If you do discover a great, unexpected and unknown combination – by all means let us know, we’d love to give it a try!
    
    <h2> 2. Get to know your palate</h2>
    Ever questioned why some people are drawn towards savoury foods and others more towards sweet flavours? Why some people prefer to only drink slightly sweet, light bodied white wines and others enjoy the heaviest and richest red wines going? This ‘decision’ may be informed by your genetics, or more precisely the number of taste buds on your palate.
    
    Having a quick look at your tongue in the mirror will reveal a whole host of lumps and bumps, these taste buds perceive salt, sweetness, acidity, bitterness and umami savoury character in the food that we eat.
    
    The number and location of these taste buds varies enormously from person to person and so it will come as no surprise that we all taste food and wine very differently. The key is to trust your own palate, if you do not enjoy a particular food and wine combination then don’t have it again, no Sommelier or wine expert can anticipate your preferences.
    
    <h2>Understand how different foods impact how your wine tastes</h2> 
    Consider when you brush your teeth then immediately drink some orange juice. Does it taste strange and incredibly acidic? The orange juice has not changed, the toothpaste has changed your perception of the orange juice. The same thing happens when tasting a wine immediately after sampling a food high in salt, acidity, sugar, fat or chilli – you perceive the wine as tasting different.  For most people a good food and wine match is one that makes the wine seem softer, sweeter and fruiter.
    
    Now for some home-schooling – prepare some salt, lemon and a piece of salty mature cheddar cheese on a plate. Grab yourself a glass of young Chianti Classico or any wine that has refreshing high acidity and high tannin (that’s the bitter drying part of red wine). Have a sip of the wine and concentrate on its astringency and bitterness. Put some of the lemon juice and salt on your tongue and have a chew – this might seem strange but stay with me – when you re-try the wine now it will be softer, fruiter and much smoother. Do the same with a bite of the salty cheddar cheese and have another go. The fat in the cheese will make the wine seem even smoother.
    
    This is the magic triangle of salt, acidity and fat, and having these on your palate before an acidic, astringent and tannic wine will help soften it up.
    
    <h2>Be flexible in your food and wine choices</h2> 
    The key to getting the best wine match for a meal is to understand the base components of the dish.
    
    Classic matches such as a salty rib eye steak and a tannic and acidic Barolo work well for most people because the combination of salt and fat on the steak will smooth the tannins and make the wine softer and smoother. If you don’t want to splash out on a Barolo, any high acidity and tannic red wine will work, try one from Madiran for a good value match made in heaven.
    
    This principle works well with other dishes with similar base flavours – so vegetarians could achieve the same with a fatty, salty, acidic vegetarian Moussaka for example.
    
    Muscadet or Champagne are classic matches for oysters because the high acidity in the wine is softened by the tangy lemon juice or vinegar accompaniment of the oyster. In the same way, high acidity wines like Albariño, Gavi or Chablis are also a safe bet for sipping with your shellfish.
    
    Want to enjoy a zingy white, but not a fan of oysters? A simple Tuna Niçoise salad with a strong sharp dressing will act in the same way.
    
    There is a lot more to learn, but the key is to discover for yourself and not be dictated to. Choose wines you enjoy and think about the salt, fat and acidity in your food.
    
    Most importantly, whatever budget you have, just have fun and experiment. After all, that is what wine is all about.

<p>Most of our 2020 dining experiences to date have been home-based. Even as cafes, restaurants and bars begin to open over the coming months, whether we like it or not, we will still have to rely on eating and drinking at home much more than we did before the current crisis.
  While takeaway meals may not excite fellow wine enthusiasts as much as dining out, you can still successfully experiment with food and wine pairings from the comfort of your dining table or sofa.
  
  The first rule of thumb is that wine does not affect food nearly as much as food affects wine. The second rule - don’t be ruled by rules! While there are traditional food and wine pairings we love and adore, the possibilities are endless and depend on your personal tastes and preferences.
  
  We start by identifying the main groups of take-away food: salty, acidic, highly flavoured, fatty and oily, hot and spicy, sweet, and savoury or ‘umami’. Next, we explore the possible effects that each food type will have on the taste of certain wines. For example, salty foods can make tannic wines smoother and more palatable, acidic foods can soften highly acidic wines, sweet foods can even out the rich and fruity characters of dessert wine, and so on.
  
  So, as you place that order, here are some tips on how to make successful wine pairings with your favourite takeaway meals.
  
  Tomato-based: Pizza, Pasta
  Food Type(s): acidic, salty
  Pairing Category: high-acid red wines
  Suggested Wines: Barbera, Corvina, Lambrusco, Nebbiolo, Sangiovese
  
  Tomatoes are the epitome of acid and need wines with equal freshness. High-acid red wines are not only up for the challenge, but their herbal and earthy characteristics also complement other classic ingredients of this style of cuisine such as basil, oregano and mushrooms.
  
  Tomato-based dishes often require a significant amount of salt alkalinity to balance their acidity. The salt helps to soften the wine’s tannins and acidity and enhance the wine’s fruit characteristics for a more pleasurable tasting experience.
  
  Mediterranean: Antipasti, Falafel, Stuffed Grape Leaves
  Food Type(s): salty, oily
  
  Pairing Category: structured whites with natural acidity
  
  Suggested Wines: Assyrtiko, Carricante, Falanghina, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino
  
  Foods in this category share two things in common: salt and oil. Zesty white wines with structure are good partners for this style of cuisine as the salt and oil soften their acidity while highlighting their fruit and floral notes.
  
  Unsurprisingly, many of the wines that fit the bill come from Mediterranean vineyards. From the rugged coastlines of Italy to the Greek islands, these white wines have the body and brisk acidity to guarantee wine pairing heaven for a Mediterranean meal.
  
  
  Meaty: Burger, Kebab, BBQ
  Food Type(s): salty, highly flavoured
  Pairing Category: full-bodied red wines
  Suggested Wines: Cabernet Sauvignon, Grenache, Syrah, Tempranillo, red blends
  
  Meats are often highly salted and flavoured making them perfect for showcasing the structure and concentration of tannic red wines. Intensely flavoured wines will not be overwhelmed by well-seasoned meats, happily playing along with various sauces and spice blends.
  
  However, these foods also tend to have a high-fat content. So, selecting red varieties which also have good acidity is important as it will be needed to cut through the fat. This is where red blends such as Bordeaux and Côtes du Rhône have a useful role to play.
  
  Asian Cuisine: Ramen, Thai Curry, Chow Mein
  Food Type(s): umami
  
  Pairing Category: high-acid whites and light reds
  
  Suggested Wines: Grüner Veltliner, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Gamay, Pinot Noir
  
  By far the trickiest category to pair with, umami-driven foods tend to make wines taste more bitter while dulling their fruity characteristics. This can be particularly detrimental to tannic wines. This said, there is still quite a wide spectrum of wines that would pair well with these dishes. While you want enough acidity to keep the palate clean and crisp, the key is to consider wines intense enough to retain their fruit characteristics in the presence of umami. Think aromatic white varieties such as Grüner Veltliner, Riesling and Sauvignon Blanc.
  
  If you’re in the mood for red, the trick is to stick to varieties with high acidity and low tannins, such as Gamay and Pinot Noir. Try one of these with a serving of Peking duck for a seriously good match.
  
  
  
  Fried: Chicken, Chips, Arancini
  Food Type(s): fatty/oily, salty
  
  Pairing Category: sparkling wines
  
  Suggested Wines: Cava, Champagne, Crémant, Moscato d'Asti, Prosecco
  
  After eating healthily all week, come the weekend you’re allowed to indulge in some finger-lickin’ fried food. The best part of all is that fried foods pair beautifully with sparkling wine. The acidic nature of sparkling wine zips right through the fat, oil and salt in these foods for a refreshing palate cleanse after each bite. 
  
  Depending on your sparkling preferences, you can pair fried foods with a wide range of sweetness levels - from Brut Nature all the way to the frothy lusciousness of Moscato d'Asti. If there is acid, there is a way to find a delectable pairing. And, as if you needed more reasons for this pairing, the bready autolytic notes of traditional method sparkling wines can also offer a winning touch to this combo.
